#operators
# +,-,*,/, % just like in java
#** for exponentiation
#// divides and rounds down (floor divison)
#all previous operators have an assignment variation 
#just add = after it. example: %=

#bitwise
#&, |, ^, ~, <<, >> 
#also have assignment variation except ~

#comparison
#same as everything in java: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=

#logical
#java || -> python or
#java && -> python and
#java ! -> python not

#identity
#is      x is y (returns true if both variables are same object)
#is not        (opposite of above)

#membership
#in
#not in
#self-explanatory
#can be used with structure types and normal types(any objects in fact. Which translates to everything since apparently everything in python is an object)
